the earth is not just another planet! it contains one hundred and eleven kings (including, of course, the african kings), seven thousand geographers, nine hundred thousand businessmen, seven-and-a-half million drunkards, three-hundred-eleven million vain men; in other words, about two billion grown-ups.to give you a notion of the earth's dimensions, i can tell you that before the invention of electricity, it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of six continents, a veritable army of four-hundred-sixty-two thousand, five hundred and eleven lamplighters.seen from some distance, this made a splendid effect. the movements of this army were ordered like those of a ballet. first came the turn of the lamplighters of new zealand and australia; then these, having lit their street lamps, would go home to sleep. next it would be the turn of the lamplighters of china and siberia to perform their steps in the lamplighters' ballet, and then they too would vanish into the wings. then came the turn of the lamplighters of russia and india. then those of africa and europe. then those of south america, and of north america. and they never missed their cues for their appearances onstage. it was awe inspiring.only the lamplighter of the single street lamp at the north pole and his colleague of the single street lamp at the south pole led carefree, idle lives: they worked twice a year.
