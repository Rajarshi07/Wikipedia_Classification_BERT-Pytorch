mr marvel was walking painfully through the thick woods on the road to bramblehurst. he looked very unhappy and was carrying three books and some clothes wrapped in a blue tablecloth. a voice went with him and he was held tightly by unseen hands.'if you try to escape again,' said the voice, 'i will kill you.''i didn't try to escape,' said mr marvel.the voice swore a few times and then stopped. mr marvel, who was not used to so much work, was very tired. there was silence for a time. then, 'i shall have to make use of you. you are a poor creature, but i must.''yes, i am,' said marvel.'you are,' said the voice.'i'm not strong,' said marvel. then after a short silence he repeated, 'i'm not strong. i've got a weak heart. i can't do what you want.''i'll make you,' said the voice.'i wish i was dead,' said marvel.'go on! walk! move!' said the voice.'it's cruel,' said marvel.'be quiet,' said the voice. 'i'll see that you're all right. but be quiet. i want to think.'soon they saw the lights of a village.'i shall keep my hand on your shoulder,' said the voice. 'go straight through the village, and don't try to say anything to anybody.'
