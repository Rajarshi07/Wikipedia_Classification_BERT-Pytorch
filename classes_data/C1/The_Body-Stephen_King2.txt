we'd all heard about it on the radio, of course. we had our old radio on all the time, listening to pop music - elvis presley, roy orbison and the rest. when the news came on we usually stopped listening, but the ray brower story was different: he was our age and from chamberlain, a town about forty miles away from castle rock.three days before vern burst into the clubhouse, ray brower had gone out with one of his mother's buckets to pick wild fruit. when night fell and he still hadn't returned, his mother called the police and the search started. but three days later no one had found him. we knew, from listening to the story on the radio, that they were never going to find him alive. sooner or later they would just stop searching. they were already sending divers down into the pools and lakes.nothing like that could happen in south-west maine today.suburbs have spread over most of the land. the forest is still there in places, but if you walk steadily in a single direction you'll find a road sooner or later. but in those days it was possible to walk into the forest and lose your direction there and die.
