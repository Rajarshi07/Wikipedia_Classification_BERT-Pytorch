the most important things are the hardest things to say. they are the things you get ashamed of, because words make them smaller. when they were in your head they were limitless; but when they come out they seem to be no bigger than normal things. but that's not all. the most important things he too close to wherever your secret heart is buried; they are clues that could guide your enemies to a prize they would love to steal. it's hard and painful for you to talk about these things... and then people just look at you strangely. they haven't understood what you've said at all, or why you almost cried while you were saying it.i was twelve, nearly thirteen, when i first saw a dead person. it happened in 1960, a long time ago... although sometimes it doesn't seem very long to me. especially on the nights when i wake up from dreams in which the hail falls into his open eyes.
