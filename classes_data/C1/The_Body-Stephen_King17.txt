we walked on, and were beginning to think that we were getting close. but we weren't as close as we thought. we knew we wanted to reach the place where the back harlow road met the tracks, we knew that the back harlow road ran by the royal river, and we knew the royal river was only ten miles from castle river. but those ten miles were measured in a straight line, and the railway tracks made a long, slight curve around some hills called the bluffs. if we had looked at a map we'd have seen that curve easily, and we'd have realized that it was more like sixteen miles between the two rivers, walking along the tracks. and there was nowhere else to walk.chris began to suspect the truth when midday had come and gone and the royal still hadn't appeared. we stopped while he climbed a tall tree and looked round. he came down and told us it was going to be at least four in the afternoon before we reached the royal, if we moved fast.'jesus!' teddy swore. 'what are we going to do now?'we looked into each other's sweaty faces. we were hungry and tired. the big adventure had turned into hard work. we were dirty and sometimes frightened. by now our parents would be wondering where we were, and the police might even be looking for us if milo pressman or the engineer on the train crossing the bridge had told them anything. we had been planning to hitchhike back to castle rock, but four o'clock was just three hours from dark and nobody picks up four boys in a back country road after dark.finally chris said, 'it's still closer if we carry on. let's go.'he turned and started to walk along the tracks in his dusty shoes, head down, his shadow short at his feet. a few seconds later the rest of us followed, one after another.
