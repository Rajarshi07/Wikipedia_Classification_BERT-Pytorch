'i searched for hours. it was late at night, and i was tired. i lay down in a barn to rest for a few minutes, but then i fell asleep. in the morning, i woke up feeling ill, so i went home and went to bed. i do not know how the locket, with the picture of mrs frankenstein inside, came to be in my pocket.'they did not believe her. justine was found guilty of the murder. i felt sick with horror and despair. the next day she was hanged. elizabeth wept, but her sadness was the sadness of innocence. i, the true murderer, had no hope or comfort.
