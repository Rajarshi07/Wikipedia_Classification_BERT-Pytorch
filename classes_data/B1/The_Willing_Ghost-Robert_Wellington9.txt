'what's wrong?' i asked.'well,' she began, 'i'm a bit sorry for my brothers. i know we don't get on well, but...'i told her that there was nothing i could do about that. but i cheered her up a little by saying that her brothers might learn a lesson by having to spend a little time in prison. and, anyway, their sentences were sure to be much smaller than those of the three asiar ringleaders. her brothers didn't have police records, and i told her that it was clear to the police that they were used and manipulated by the other gang members.'i suppose i should pay you, richard,' she then said.'that's a good idea,' i replied.she went to a chest of drawers, opened a drawer, and took out a cheque book.'is a cheque alright?' she asked.'fine,' i said.but i didn't go to selena's house just to tell her what snout told me. nor to be paid. i had something else on my mind.'selena... i was wondering... well, i mean... the fact is, when i finish a case, i like to go out and celebrate. there's a little french restaurant in soho... very good food, excellent fish... and, well, i was wondering if you would like to have dinner there with me tonight?' finally, i said it.her eyes brightened and she gave me a beautiful smile. 'i'd love to, richard.'so we made the arrangements and i left the house. i wanted to dance down the driveway. the case was solved. i had some money in my pocket. and i had a beautiful girl to take out to dinner that night. life was treating me well. the last line of one of everyone's favourite old films came to my mind. as i tried to sound like humphrey bogart in casablanca, i repeated it to myself. 'yes,' i said, 'this could be the start of a beautiful friendship.'
