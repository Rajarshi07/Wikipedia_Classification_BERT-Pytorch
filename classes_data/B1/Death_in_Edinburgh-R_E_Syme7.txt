ross sounded angry and began talking before angus could really speak. apparently the main suspect, the guy who had been questioned, had an airtight alibi, so he was free, and the police were back to square one.they had done some research regarding brodie's indiscretions - something which had been brought up by more than one acquaintance of the deceased, and had a new suspect. some officers were on their way at that moment to bring her in for questioning.angus felt himself go cold, "wh-who are you bringing in?""the wife," was the grim reply."are you sure?""not yet but she had a motive and knew where her husband was going. we just need to establish her whereabouts more exactly at the time of the murder. why?"angus told ross about his meeting with eleanor brodie, ending with his question about jessie."well, it's a bit irregular, but i'll ask the chief and let you know. and i know she seems respectable and he was a scumbag but that doesn't mean she didn't do it. i've got to go but i'll get back to you shortly. in the meantime, keep the dog with you and take care of her." with that they hung up and angus went to find jessie. sitting down beside her on the living room floor, he couldn't help but feel sorry for mrs brodie. he also felt a shiver at the idea that he may have just had tea with a murderer.
