one day my father said to me. 'i am glad to see that you are better, victor, but i notice that you are still sad sometimes. is it because of elizabeth? i have always hoped you and elizabeth would marry. you have loved each other since you were children, but maybe i have been blind. perhaps you love elizabeth as a sister. perhaps you love someone else and want that other person to be your wife. am i right, victor? is this the reason for your sadness?''my dear father,' i replied. 'do not worry. i love elizabeth very much, and i want to marry her.''i am so happy to hear that. why not marry as soon as possible?'the idea of marrying elizabeth immediately filled me with horror. i had to create the female and see the two monsters leave europe before i could marry.an englishman had made new discoveries in science. i wanted to speak to this man before beginning work on a female for the monster. i thought it would be better to do my awful work in england, far away from my family. therefore i told my father thati had to go to england and that when i returned i would marry elizabeth. my father and elizabeth asked clerval to travel with me. at first i thought that this would make it more difficult to do my work, but then i was glad. i thought the monster would not come near me while henry was there. i did not like to leave my family alone, ignorant of their enemy. but i thought that the monster would follow me to england, so my family would be safe.clerval and i left geneva in september. on the journey, clerval noticed all the beauties of nature, but i was gloomy. slowly his love of nature tranquillized my soul, and i began to enjoy the passing landscape with him.clerval, my dear friend! where is he now? does he now only exist in my memory? no! his body is gone, but his spirit still visits me!forgive me for showing my sorrow. it is so painful to remember him. i will continue my story.
