my father became ill with sadness and grief. elizabeth grew pale and thin. i felt horribly guilty. my only comfort was to escape to the mountains and forget my sorrows for a few days. the mountains and rivers were made by god. in the magnificent alpine valleys, i felt his power and was afraid of nothing else.on one of these journeys, in august, nearly two years after the death of justine, i entered the valley of chamonix. rivers of ice came down from the mountains. the great white dome of mont blanc stood above me. i decided to climb montanvert. i remembered the view from the top of the mountain. that sublime landscape alone could tranquillize my soul.
