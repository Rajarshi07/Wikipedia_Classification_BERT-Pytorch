'and there are two canoes.'suddenly, some hurons ran from the trees on the island. they got into the two canoes.'they are following us,' said duncan. 'paddle faster!''no! stop paddling, chingachgook,' said hawk-eye. 'i will shoot them.' and he lifted his long gun.he fired. a huron in the first canoe fell into the lake. the hurons stopped their two canoes. they did not follow.chingachgook and uncas started paddling again. the five men went on. they went north, up the lake.
