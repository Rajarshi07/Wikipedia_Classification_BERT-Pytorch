in september 1953, there was a photo of audrey on the front of time magazine. "she shines with fire in her beautiful eyes," the magazine wrote. the world was in love with audrey hepburn, but audrey was only in love with one man. she wanted to be with mel ferrer all the time. he produced a play for her on broadway, ondine, and she acted in it with him for six months. people liked ondine, and audrey acted beautifully.she won an oscar for best actress in roman holiday. three days later she won a tony for best actress in ondine.these were exciting times for audrey, but she was very tired. she had to have a vacation, so she flew to switzerland.she loved switzerland. she felt safe there, away from the people and noise of the big cities. she could see white mountains from her windows. maybe she remembered more than twenty years before-a little girl in her father's arms with lights as white as snow above her head?
