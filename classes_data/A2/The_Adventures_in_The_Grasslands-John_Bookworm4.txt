spotty is walking with his mum. he is one or two weeks because they are not walking with other giraffes. he is too young for that.i look at bill. oh no! he is looking at my spotty and smiling. he likes him, too. now he starts walking to the mum and her baby.i hope giraffes are clever animals. this small walking thing (bill) doesn't look like a tree. trees are tall and smell nice.but bill isn't so silly. he stops and breaks off some small twigs with juicy green leaves. oh, he is holding a lot of twigs. now he smells nice for giraffes.he walks on, and i walk behind him. i think and think how i can stop him. suddenly i have an idea. you know, i am very good at making animal sounds. i put my hands to my mouth and make a terrible lion 'roar!'bill jumps up, drops his twig sand turns round fast. i look afraid, too.'there's a lion here!' he cries.he is shaking. his face is white.he looks at a tall tree. 'jack, we must climb a tree,' he says. that tree hasn't got low branches. so i can't understand how we can climb it. but bill can! he is on top of the tree in a second. wow! he is very strong!now bill is sitting in the tree and looking around. 'jack, come here!' he cries.but i don't want to climb a tree. it is too hot. 'are there any lions?' i ask.'i can't see any!' he cries. but bill is too afraid to climb down.i'm looking at him. he looks like a thick branch with five green leaves. it is interesting how long he can sit in a tree.i sit down on the grass. it is very hot, but i am under a tree. it is great here. now i can have a rest.
