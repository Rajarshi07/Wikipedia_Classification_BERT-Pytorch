audrey began to have problems after breakfast at tiffany's. mel was not happy. "audrey's becoming more and more famous," he thought. "maybe she doesn't love me."audrey had other problems too. she was a schoolteacher in the loudest whisper with shirley maclaine, but the movie was not successful. it was boring, people thought. one day her dog, mr. famous, ran into the road. a car hit him and he died. then in 1962 she made a very bad movie, paris when it sizzles. william holden was also in the movie. he fell in love with audrey in sabrina, and he was in love with her ten years later. he could not forget her, and he drank. in the evenings, audrey often went to dinner with her old friend givenchy. she told him about mr. famous and her problems with william holden."but there's something worse than that," she said sadly. "things are not good with mel and me."after paris when it sizzles, audrey became happier. she made charade with cary grant, and this was a better movie. it was beautiful and intelligent, funny, and exciting. "maybe," she thought, "the bad times are at an end."one day, in the winter of 1962, audrey was at home in switzerland with her two-year-old son. suddenly she heard the telephone. audrey answered it. "are you sitting down?" somebody said from hollywood. "you are going to be eliza doolittle in my fair lady!"
