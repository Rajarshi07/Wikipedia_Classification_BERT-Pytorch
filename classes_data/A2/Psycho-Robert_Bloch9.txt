after phoning lila with the news of his conversation with norman bates, arbogast drove back to the motel. there was a light in the office, and the sign was now on, but he couldn't find norman anywhere. looking up at the old house, he could still see the old woman by the window. he could see her shadow behind the curtain.'i'll have to go and speak to her without her son's help,' he thought.after climbing the hill, arbogast found that the front door was open. he walked inside, took his hat off and waited for a few seconds. everything was quiet. he looked at the mirror, the flowers on the wallpaper, the old pictures on the wall.feeling sure that the son was busy somewhere, he decided to go upstairs and talk to the mother alone. he walked up the stairs very slowly. he didn't want to make a noise. and, if he was honest, he felt a little afraid. with its old furniture and silent rooms, this house was very strange.at the top of the stairs, arbogast heard the sound of the bedroom door. he turned round and saw the old woman. she was running straight towards him, with her long dress, white face and cold, mad eyes. he was too surprised to move. he saw the large silver knife above her head, and he tried to lift his hands, but he was too late.the knife cut his face open from the top of his head, through his left eye, to the corner of his mouth. he fell back, down the stairs, and lay very still. he couldn't move his arms or legs, but he could lift his head. with his one good eye he looked up the stairs - the old woman was flying down towards him, the silver knife in her hand, screaming like an animal. the last thing that he ever saw was the terrible white face above him, as she brought the knife down straight into his heart.
