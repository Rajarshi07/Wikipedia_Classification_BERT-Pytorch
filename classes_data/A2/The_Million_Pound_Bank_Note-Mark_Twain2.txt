when i arrived, the same servant opened the door. i asked for the two gentlemen."they are gone," the servant said."gone? gone where?""oh, on a journey.""but, where did they go?""to the continent, i think.""the continent?"there were no signature, no address, no date on the letter.how strange! i didn't know what to think. i went to a park, sat down and thought about what to do. after an hour, i reached the decision that follows.the two old gentlemen are playing a game that i don't understand. they are betting on me. (but, at that time, i didn't know anything about the details of the bet.)if i go to the bank of england to return the banknote, the bank will ask me lots of questions. if i tell the truth, no one will believe me. they will put me in an asylum. if i tell a lie, the police will put me in prison. i can't even give it to anyone, because no honest person will want it.i can do only one thing: i must keep the bill for a whole month. and, i must not lose it. if i help the old man to win his bet, he will give me the job i want.the idea of an important job with a big salary made me happy. with this exciting idea in mind, i began walking down the streets of london.
