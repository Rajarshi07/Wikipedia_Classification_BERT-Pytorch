spotty's mum is thirsty. i know that because she is going to a waterhole. the waterhole is big, but there is a lot of mud around it. it is very bad for giraffes. they can fall in the mud and often can't get up. then they die there.so i am very afraid for spotty and his mum. but bill is happy. 'great!' he cries. 'when they are in the mud, we can catch the baby.' again he takes the rope in his hands and goes to the waterhole.i can't stop spotty's mum. she is in the mud now. but she says something to spotty because he doesn't go after her. he walks around the mud.now the mother stops. she puts her legs far from each other. then she puts her neck down. now her mouth can get the water. she looks very funny when she is drinking like that.'it's time to catch the baby!' bill says. 'his mum can't help him.'i don't know what to do, but i must do something. so i say:'who knows? she is strong and runs fast. let's catch her first.' bill looks at the mother and then at a big tree next to the mud. 'you are right. we should tie her to that tree,' he says.bill gets the rope and we come up to the mud. bill wants to throw the loop around the mother's neck, but i say, 'the rope is too short. you must stand in the mud.' bill looks at the rope and then at spotty's mum. he walks into the mud.'now you stay here,' i say. 'i must run round and stand opposite her. remember? i'm the red light.''oh, i see,' bill says. 'jack, you are cool!'so i run around the waterhole and stand opposite spotty's mum. i hope she can see me. yes, she can! she stops drinking and looks at me. she can see my red colour! she doesn't like it. she turns her neck to look at spotty. at this moment bill throws the rope.
