bill isn't very clever, but he is kind. he can't hunt spotty anymore. he looks at me. 'jack, you are right. it's wrong to catch giraffes. they must walk free. but what should i tell jill? she can get very angry. and i love her!' he sits down on the grass. he is very sad.'i know what we should do,' i say. then i talk and talk. soon bill knows my idea. he likes it.'i hope it helps,' he says.so we take the rope and go home. the mud on us is dry now, and our skin hurts. so we can't walk fast. when we are in front of the door, jill opens it and jumps up.'what's the matter with you?' she cries. and then we say:'dear jill, there are lots of giraffes in the grasslands. they are all very tall and beautiful. we can't choose only one. if you want a pet giraffe, let's go to the grasslands together. then you can show us your favourite one. only don't put on many clothes. put on a swimming costume.'jill doesn't understand. 'a swimming costume? why do i need a swimming costume there?''because there are angry lionesses there,' i say. 'when they are hungry, they run at you. they run very fast. you can't run away from them. so you must hide in a muddy waterhole. and when you get out of the mud, your clothes are dirty.''and very heavy,' says bill.'yes,' i say. 'then you can't walk fast in them. and when angry elephants come and start breaking trees...''oh!' jill stops me. she looks afraid now. 'i think i don't need a pet giraffe. i've got no free time, and our house isn't very tall.''we can make a big hole in the roof,' i say.'are you crazy?' jill asks. 'i don't want any holes in my roof. i don't need a giraffe. that's all!''ok,' we say. 'can we go to the bathroom now?'
