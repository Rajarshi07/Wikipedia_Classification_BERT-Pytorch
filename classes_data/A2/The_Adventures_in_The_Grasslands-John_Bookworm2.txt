my alarm clock rings. i wake up. it is sunny and hot. i am happy. it is the first day of the summer holidays. i am free. i can swim or play football.suddenly i remember my sister and her silly husband. they want to have a pet giraffe. today bill is going to the grasslands. he wants to catch a nice baby giraffe. and i am going with him. i hope he can't catch it.i look at the clock. it is six o'clock. my parents are at work. i get up, put on my shorts and a t-shirt. they are bright red. i don't often wear red, but today this colour can help me. dad says giraffes can see some bright colours. i hope they can see the red colour. i put on a red cap, open the door and go out.i run to bill and jill's house. when i am at their door, bill comes out. he is wearing a brown shirt and brown shorts. he has got a green cap on his head and green gloves on his hands. he has got a big green bag on his back. he thinks he looks like a small tree with four green leaves.'a nice tree!' i say.'where?' bill asks.'opposite me, of course,' i say.'aha, i'm very clever!' bill says and smiles.suddenly bill stops smiling. he is looking at my red costume.'why are you wearing red?' he asks. 'you don't look like a tree.''but i'm not a tree,' i say. 'i'm the red light. what do you do when you see the red light in the street?''i stop,' bill says.'i stop too,' i say. 'everyone stops: men and women, boys and girls, cats and dogs, and, of course, giraffes.''you are great!' bill cries and smiles at me again.
