summer tourists were arriving in woodend. the weather was beautiful and the shop was doing well.but anna was not very happy. she often thought about greta gordon's visit. why had she come to see dave? what had happened to the diamond rings on her fingers?there was another problem. anna loved peter and she was going to marry him. but she liked dave too. dave was older, but she liked him. all the women liked him. but anna was very close to him all day. in the daytime, anna was with dave. in the evening, she was with peter. anna was living two lives. one life was with dave, the other life with peter.then one friday, dave surprised anna.'what are you doing tomorrow?' he asked her. 'would you like to spend the day with me? we can go anywhere you like. we can go in my car.''i'm sorry, dave,' said anna. 'but peter wouldn't like it!''don't be silly,' said dave. 'we won't go far! i'll close the shop at lunchtime and we can go to lidney.'anna wanted to go with dave, but she was worried about peter.'don't worry about peter,' said dave. 'he's always busy on saturday.'anna thought for a moment. 'all right,' she said. 'you take me to the best cinema and to the best restaurant. then i'll come with you.''of course!' laughed dave. 'anything you want, anna!'so the next afternoon dave and anna went together to lidney. they had a good time. dave bought anna a new, expensive dress. then they went to a cinema and, afterwards, to a restaurant.peter played cricket that saturday. he never knew about anna's day with dave. he was playing in another village and returned to woodend very late.dave and anna were also very late. dave stopped his car near the corner shop. the night was warm.thanks, dave,' said anna. 'it was a lovely day.''i enjoyed it too,' said dave. he put his arm round her shoulders and kissed her.it was a quick kiss. but for anna, it was wonderful.
