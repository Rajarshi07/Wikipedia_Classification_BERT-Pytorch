audrey wanted to do the movie, but she was nervous about the story. she usually played nice girls-princesses, dancers, nuns - but the girl in breakfast at tiffany's is not nice. she leaves her husband and goes to new york. she is friendly with bad people. audrey was also nervous because truman capote did not really want her in the movie. he wanted marilyn monroe. "maybe the part isn't right for me," she thought.the director, blake edwards, visited audrey in switzerland. "it is the right part for you," he told her. "you're one of the five biggest actresses in the world. you can do anything. it's time to do something different and dangerous. yes, holly's a bad girl. but behind her expensive clothes and dark glasses, she's only a child." audrey made breakfast at tiffany's in new york and it came to the movie theaters in 1961. "she's a european princess; she can't act the part of a poor american horse doctor's wife," some people said. but most people liked the movie very much. in her dark glasses and givenchy clothes, audrey was beautiful, crazy, and funny. and they loved her when she sadly sang moon river at her bedroom window.
