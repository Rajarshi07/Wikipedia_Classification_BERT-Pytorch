when i was 27 years old, i worked in an office in san francisco. i did my job well and my future was promising. i was alone in the world and i was happy.on saturday afternoons i didn't work. i sailed my little sailboat on san francisco bay. one saturday afternoon, i sailed out too far. the strong afternoon wind pushed my sailboat out of the bay, into the pacific ocean.that night, when i had lost all hope, a small british brig saw me and took me on board. the brig was sailing to london. the voyage was long and stormy. i worked as a sailor to pay for my trip.when i arrived in london, my clothes were old and dirty. i had only one dollar in my pocket. with this dollar, i ate and slept for the first twenty-four hours. during the next twenty-four hours, i didn't eat and didn't sleep.at about ten o'clock the following morning, i went to portland place. i saw a child walking past, holding a big pear. the child ate one small piece and then threw the pear onto the street.i stopped and looked at it.i was very hungry and i really wanted that pear. but every time i tried to get it, someone passed by and looked at me. i quickly turned in the other direction and waited for the person to pass by. i tried again and again to get that pear, but the same thing happened. i was desperate. i decided to get the pear and not to worry about the people who saw me. at that moment, a gentleman opened a window behind me and said, "come in here, please."a well-dressed servant opened the door. he took me to a beautiful room.here, two old gentlemen were sitting and discussing something important.their breakfast was on the table. i was very hungry and i stared at their breakfast.i want to tell the reader that the two gentlemen had made a bet several days before. i knew nothing about the bet until later. let me tell you what happened.
