salahadin got home very late. it was nearly midnight and he was very tired. but his work was not yet finished. he took some pieces of paper out of his wallet. they were the pieces of paper from pearson's room. salahadin sat down and looked at pearson's notes.the pharaoh ankuten.this pharaoh did not live long.he died when he was still a boy.where was ankuten buried?ankuten was going to the sudan when he did it.the valley of zar is beside the road to the sudan.was ankuten buried in the valley of zar?what was buried with ankuten in his tomb?was there a cat buried with ankuten?there are many old stories about a black cat.ankuten loved black cats.when he died, a black cat was put in his tomb.but this cat was very usual.it was made of gold. its eyes were diamonds.there was a collar of diamonds round its neck.is this story true or not?why was the cat covered with black paint?fear of robbers.black paint hid the gold and diamonds.a cat painted in thick black paint did not look valuable.questions that must be answered:is ankuten buried in the valley of zar?is there a black cat in his tomb?is the black cat made of gold?or is it made of wood?are the stories true or false.salahadin read the notes again. he asked himself some questions. did pearson find the tomb of ankuten? he asked himself. did he find a black cat? and is the black cat made of gold? there was a reason for pearson's death. was the black cat the reason? there are too many questions, thought salahadin. i must find some answers. the answers are in the missing box and it's probably on its way to beirut. i'll be there tomorrow.
