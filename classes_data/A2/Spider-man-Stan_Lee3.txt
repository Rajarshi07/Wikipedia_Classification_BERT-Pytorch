'good work!'then he turned to peter. 'and peter - the best science student in the school! that's fantastic!'mr osborn looked at peter. 'life isn't easy for you right now,' he said. try to enjoy the day. it's the start of something new.' then he smiled. 'you're almost a brother to harry. that makes you family.'peter smiled back. but he was frightened. his 'spider sense' saw something terrible in mr osborn's eyes.***harry saw mj and flash. mj didn't look happy. flash looked very angry. then flash walked away.'it's over for mj and flash,' thought harry. 'good!'***later that day, peter sat quietly at home. he thought about uncle ben and he started to cry. then he remembered uncle ben's words. 'with great power comes great responsibility.' something in peter woke up.'i'm strong,' he thought. 'and i'm a good person. i must help other people. uncle ben was right!'
