i am watching spotty. he is so cute! he isn't drinking milk anymore. he is jumping. he wants to play. now i can see a shadow. it is the shadow of a rope with a loop. bill is holding it and coming to the giraffes. he is hiding behind every bush. he is very slow. suddenly spotty's mum starts running. spotty runs with her. soon they are far from bill and me. i look at bill. he isn't hiding anymore. he is angry. he can't catch them again.i climb a tree and look around. i can see my giraffes. they are running and playing. they look so funny now! but they are running in a circle. soon they are coming back. they are close again.'look,' bill says. 'there are small birds on the mother and her baby. do birds live on giraffes?''of course, they don't,' i say. 'they eat on giraffes. giraffes are their dining room.''how terrible!' bill cries. 'i don't want to be somebody's dining room!''have you got insects in your hair?' i ask.'insects in my hair?' bill looks afraid and puts his fingers in his hair.'those birds eat insects. they are their favourite food,' i say.'are there insects on giraffes?' bill asks. he looks surprised.'yes, there are a lot of them. when you catch the baby and take it home, you can have a lot of insects too. so, it's a good idea to take three birds with you. one for the baby and two for jill and you.''but jill doesn't like birds,' bill says.'then i hope she likes insects,' i saw.'no!' bill cries. 'she doesn't!''if jill likes the giraffe, she must like its insects. there are no giraffes without insects on them.'bill starts thinking. 'look, jack, i can wash our giraffe in the bathroom.''in jill's bathroom?' i laugh. 'are you crazy?'bill looks at me and thinks again. 'then i can wash it in the garden or take it to the lake.''you can have a lot of problems with that baby,' i say. i am looking at him, and he is looking at me. poor bill! he loves my sister. he is ready to do everything for her. birds can't change it. even terrible insects can't change it.
