'now, look carefully. is anybody watching her?''there are a lot of people in the street,' sue says. 'i'm not sure. is it that man with the long hair?''perhaps,' says dan. 'let's go on. what happens next?' they watch the video. the jogger runs into the old lady. he stops and helps her. she shouts at him and he runs away. then a lot of people come and help the old lady.'look!' sue says. 'the long-haired man has her arm.''yes, but that woman has her bag,' dan says. 'what's she doing with it? oh! i can't see! there's a man in front of her!''listen, i have an idea,' dan says. 'you go to the bank tomorrow, and take some money out.''why's that a good idea?' sue asks.'because we can watch you,' dan answers.
