we walk and walk. no! bill is walking, and i am having fun. i look around and see a lot of funny insects and small animals. sometimes i see snakes, but 1 am not afraid of them. they get angry only if you hurt them or come too close. and i only look at them. oh, there is a beautiful one! it is sleeping and shining in the sun. it looks like silver rings one around the other. when they sleep, they are so nice!what's the matter? bill isn't walking anymore. he is standing and looking at some big animals far away. i look at them too. they are giraffes. they are great! some giraffes are walking and shaking their long necks. the others are standing next to trees and eating leaves.bill starts walking again. he opens his green bag and takes out a long thick rope. the rope has got a big loop at the end.my heart stops beating. i am so sorry for those beautiful animals. i must do something! but i am only twelve, and bill is twenty-five.suddenly i can see a small baby giraffe. i think it is a boy. he is very young. he can't run fast. his mother is looking at him with love. she looks very happy and proud. i understand her. she has got a great baby. her son is tall and his skin has got dark brown spots. they look like squares with white lines around. my dad says there are many different kinds of giraffe. here in east africa we have three kinds. this kind is my favourites. oh, i have got a name for this nice baby. it is spotty.
